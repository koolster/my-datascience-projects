North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity.

The fear is that if MJ is legal, rampant use could lead to people getting into harder drugs to the detriment of society. However, I argue that this point can be sustained without sentencing MJ traffickers and users to death. Perhaps there can be a very conservative ceiling on the amount a person can consume or carry, and heavily-regulated supply chains and stores for buying and consumption. People who flout the law could be sentenced to jail / caning as per other serious offences. Furthermore, while some research note that some MJ users do go on to use harder drugs, most do not. Heightened response to other drugs is also not unique to MJ - alcohol causes such a response too.\n",
