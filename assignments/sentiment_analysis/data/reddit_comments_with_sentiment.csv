He did not touch the drugs or was at the location. A Malaysian mule did the delivery and a Singapore mule assigned to do the pick-up. Both mules were arrested by CNB and he kept communicating with them without realising they were arrested. CNB also listened in to the call and guided the  conversation of the Malaysian mule. 

He was convicted on the strength of what Justice Hoo called “objective evidence” - the numerous logged calls he made the day before and that day from his 2 mobiles to the mules even after the arrest. This is over and above the 2 mules implicating him. 

He did not disclose his upstream and downstream suppliers and dealers and repeatedly denied even making the calls. He could not explain why the calls came from his mobiles.

10,2023-04-24 09:52:08,12wypqz,Why Tangaraju Suppiah doesn’t deserve to die,jhha4uk,Paullesq,"The argument is that the mandatory death penalty is ineffectual because you tend to wind up executing large numbers of mules who basically don't impact the drug trade. Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture. TBH, I never really agreed with this argument because I think that the death penalty should perhaps only be used in the case of premeditated murder. A life for a life. Anything else is morally incoherent.

That said, if you want to make a strawman that makes other people sound hypocritical, that may not be the characterization your should be fighting for.

If you want to make accusations about hypocrisy, maybe look at the Sg government? We launder money from HNW government figures from narco states like North Korea and Myanmar. We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.

I think the party whose stance on drugs is ' we are going to kill you for smuggling drugs until you start making above a certain amount of money then we are going to become accomplices and help you launder it and turn a blind eye when you recruit our residents' is the one that is hypocritical.

Tangaraju’s alleged co-conspirator – who was actually caught in possession of the drugs – pleaded guilty to a non-capital offence.

Mogan never confirmed that the two numbers which were used by Tangaraju were his. Yet the judge erroneously concluded this.

Mogan was also informed that the recipient of cannabis was 1.76m tall and wore a lot of gold jewellery. This fits Suresh's description and not Tangaraju. This was confirmed at trial. Suresh also received sms messages which suggest that many people were expecting to collect drugs from Suresh and not Tangaraju.

The judge also accepted that Suresh was involved in the drug trade and collected drugs for others. Suresh himself was surprised that Tangaraju was charged.

Desistance is not just about stopping the acts of drug taking, but also about believing in yourself adopting a new identity from before (you are no longer an addict and therefore will not partake in such an activity any further) 

It’s not as simple as we might want to make it out to be. Too often victims of drugs are first victims of many other social issues (poverty, family, poor support systems etc)

If he had gotten addicted as a child/youth, without a sufficient support system it would not be difficult to see how it would literally change and define his adult life. If drugs are their coping mechanism, when life gets tough they will always go back to what is familiar and comforting to them. 

We like to brush them off as society’s rejects, but I also often wonder: could we have done more to help them during the more vulnerable stages of their lives like in their adolescent years? We might not feel any sympathy for them being the supposed hardcore drug kingpins they are today, but it would be harsh to condemn the 14 year old they were once, trying out weed simply because they were exposed to it by other family members. And that in itself, would have detrimental knock on impacts resulting in the life that they lead today.

But those are tough questions we don’t really like to ask or answer. We would rather sleep well thinking solely that justice was served to a criminal, than ponder about the possibilities that they were also perhaps victims of certain extenuating circumstances that led them to where they were today. It’s easier to see them as the bogeyman, then to seriously reflect and wonder if we are doing enough as a society in terms of rehabilitation and social/systemic support.",40,reply,Negative

We know they are. They could vastly increase hiring of drug mules. Our prisons would eventually run out of space housing drug mules on life imprisonment sentences. The cost of building new prisons, hiring more prison guards and feeding drug mules for life would keep growing; at some point it would become economically unsustainable. Finally, Singapore would capitulate by further shortening prison sentences and have society shift from a state of contestation to grudging acceptance of drugs.

Those who traffic with drugs know the risk. 
 
2. Cannabis (marihuana) is proven less dangerous than alcohol or even tobacco. Marijuana is used for medical reasons in many countries. East and West.  Some countries, including Thailand, legalized recreational marihuana. 
When the mhs  is talking about 150 fewer addicts, they are wrong. People who smoke marihuana might be healthier and not addicted that for example, alcoholics, that I'm sure will be more than marihuana addicts in Singapore.  90% of cannabis consumers are not addicts majority enjoy, like having a cocktail.

Long drop hanging usually breaks the neck and causes instant death.

Compared to electric chairs and lethal injections, hanging is relatively clean and the only thing the state has to deal with is the last breath when the offender is unhooked from the rope. Electric chairs cause a great deal of suffering and the aftermath is relatively messy with tissues and fluids leaking from all orifices. Lethal dosage is a slow process of dying and as the amount to kill each human may vary, it requires continuous admission of the drug to kill and at times an anaesthetic drug to alleviate the pain. Other less conventional ways of capital punishments like death by firing squads or death by stoning is obviously a more painful way to die.

(I'm for death penalty)

Consuming it in Singapore is one thing - trying to bring it into Singapore is another. As for death penalty - I'm pretty sure its only the traffickers who gets it (might be wrong). If you consume drugs (be it 'hard' like coke of soft like 'weed') in Singapore you probably just gonna get sent to rehab or get jail time/fine. You wont get death penalty. 

If you try to bring it into Singapore (aka trafficking/smuggling), then its a whole other story that honestly shouldn't involve the whole 'should weed be legalised in sg' debate. Like come on, which country in the world will allow you to bring drugs (from another country) into their country? US legalised weed. Its still illegal to transport into their country. Try it. You'd most probably get deported + banned. If studies have shown that weed ain't even that harmful/less harmful than alcohol etc etc then why do countries make it highly illegal for you to 'traffick' cannabis into their country?

'But death penalty is too harsh/other countries dont have death penalty'. Yeah cause of factors like 1. They already have weed there so if you manage to smuggle it it wont really make an impact. sg doesnt have weed. 2. Our neighbouring countries are economically poorer (+ they have steady supply) than us so obviously more will try their luck if punishment is lax. If they even manage to make 1 delivery then its quite worth. If not? At max just get deported/jailed lorh. 3. Land size. Sg is a small country w/ limited land size. We wont have enough prisons if our too lax measures lead to more people trying to traffick and end up getting convicted in jail as a result. Our prisons will be too full + i mean i rather govt build hdb than prison.

The government has been sending a warning to those who traffick drugs that you will face a death penalty when caught with a certain threshold amount. 

Does that deter traffickers? That is a moot point because if it does, then this latest incident wouldn't happen. I am reminded of a hokkien saying: Money-losing business nobody want, but 'tai tow' (cut-head) venture, people dare. 

In Singapore, you are presumed quilty when caught and the onus is on you to prove otherwise, not the other way round. According to this latest news, he was found quilty and sentenced to death, based on circumstantial evidence and finger-pointing by others. It can be argued that some finger-pointers do so to escape culpability, while others have their own agenda why they do so. Is that right? Again, this a moot point. In my view, he should be jailed long term rather than be hanged to death...

It also states that a survey result shows that a majority of Singaporeans support the death penalty. I say, keep it but don't be so trigger-happy by making it a mandatory penalty. Instead, give the presiding judges the discretion to make that call based on real evidence....",3,reply,Negative

Many countries have legalized weed because it's clearly not a very harmful substance. It is not as toxic nor as addicting as alcohol, and it can be safely used recreationally and medicinally for chronic pain.

Singapore's main stance is derived from viewing MJ as a gateway drug to other more harmful drugs like cocaine or heroin. The fear is that if MJ is legal, rampant use could lead to people getting into harder drugs to the detriment of society. However, I argue that this point can be sustained without sentencing MJ traffickers and users to death. Perhaps there can be a very conservative ceiling on the amount a person can consume or carry, and heavily-regulated supply chains and stores for buying and consumption. People who flout the law could be sentenced to jail / caning as per other serious offences. Furthermore, while some research note that some MJ users do go on to use harder drugs, most do not. Heightened response to other drugs is also not unique to MJ - alcohol causes such a response too.

My take is that if a grown-up individual knowingly traffick drugs in Singapore they do know the punishment that ensues when they are caught. If the trafficker feels there is no way out except to make an earning. through this mean then are we not suppose to feel sorry for the families that are affected by these drugs. If we are to draw the line between cannabis and heroin on whether to give capital punishment our streets would be full of cannabis.

Also, a very common way of using weed is via inhalation, and there is nothing healthy about sucking burnt plant matter into your lungs. Just smoking alone is horrible enough and everybody hates neighbors who happily smoke with an open window, just imagine the consequences if people now smoke weed with open windows too.

Overall it might be less harmful than alcohol but you are adding additional ways for people to fuck themselves over. And I believe we can agree that if you offer ways for people to fuck themselves up, they will.

law says if you carry above x amount = death penalty, you jolly well make sure to measure by the milligram if you want to play punk here.

law says if you facilitate drug trafficking = death penalty, if you still want to do it for the $, it's high risk high return, so suck it up.

Regardless of their circumstances, answer is still death penalty. Let Branson go big with his arguments, publicise the case, let the whole world know and weep about it. This is what we set out to do - even if drug smuggling is your last resort, do it elsewhere, just not Singapore.

If you want to wax poetic about how it's inhumane, and to give them a second chance, what about the affected families? Why not, instead, give us solutions to stem drug inflow without the death penalty? It's not like there are no discussions on stemming regional drug trade at the ASEAN level, but sanctions are clearly ineffective or slow to work. So what next?

if you want to go along lines of 'but you can't OD on pot' and continue with promoting the legalisation of other harmless recreational drugs, then go through the proper channels, start a discourse on why the law should be changed, give us effective solutions and maybe one day we'll remove the death penalty.

Humans are like that, we will always go one or 2 steps beyond the law, hoping not to get caught. 

Today if we just slightly adjust our law of acceptance to cannabis, to categories it such that traffickers or abusers will not get punished as harsh. Tomorrow you'll first probably see more traffickers and slowly more abusers. And if we allow cannabis, there will be drug users who will start advocating for acceptance of other drugs. 

This is what is happening now and it's starting with cannabis. While cannabis might not be ""as severe as"" other drugs, there posses a risk of abuse. If the abuse isn't controlled it will lead to a societial down spiral. And all these control measures, all these leniency will only result greater resources to cope with these issues. 

Another example is vaping. It has greater damage than cannabis. But our youths are vaping everywhere even with law in place. Death penalty by vaping is not in place. If it's in place, you'll probably not see anyone vaping. 

It's like a rabbit hole, once you allow something, it's never going to end. 


Singapore's stance on no drugs is strict to many, but it works. Singapore doesn't need drugs. Singapore doesn't need to let her people to zone out via cannabis at the expense of a rabbit hole.

Some drugs are legal in a growing number of places now, but it is often because drug use and addiction is so widespread in society, that it is simply no longer possible to police its use, so authorities would rather just legalise it and let the medical system deal with the problem. 

It's important to understand why drug laws are often so harsh in Asia and it has its roots in the Opium Wars and the experience of China with opium in the 19th century. It destroyed one of the great ancient civilisations of the world and they still haven't recovered from it. The US is currently going through the same experience with a wide array of drugs that are destroying society and causing an unprecedented crime, homelessness, mental health and plummeting life expectancy crisis. Whatever they're doing in the US, clearly isn't working and I have some sympathy for the harsh approach that Singapore has adopted. Do you really want to be stepping over homeless drug addicts on every corner, with the associated social problems?

Even cannabis is not as benign as is often portrayed by pro-legalisation activists and users. Although you can't really overdose on it, it has been linked to psychosis and paranoid delusions. Any psychedelic drug can destroy the mental and physical health of someone when taken unsupervised, on the other hand, doctors should be able to use them for therapeutic purposes and conduct research on that basis.",4,comment,Negative

1. Don't succumb to temptation and traffic drugs, however desperate you are for cash.

2. Mix with the right company. Don't get addicted to drugs and if you already are, go for rehab before the drugs mess with your mind so much you pretty much can't do anything except become a drug mule.

3. Don't help another person carry luggage across borders and pass it to someone else, especially if that person offers you money.

4. Don't leave your luggage unattended and lock your bags (if at the airport, make sure only you touch it until it's checked in).

3. Even if you somehow get caught by law enforcement officers with drugs in your possession, tell your officers you have no idea how that stuff came into your possession. Pickpockets can make off with an unsuspecting person's wallet easily, no doubt it's easy to plant drugs on an unsuspecting person too. Of course it will most probably not suffice to convince them, but you are still a long way away from being hanged in Changi Prison.

Firstly, you'll get a lawyer under the LASCO scheme to fight your case. Tell him what happened. If you haven't got proof that you stand to make a profit from bringing the drugs in, the prosecutors will find it difficult to charge you for trafficking drugs, let alone bring you to the hangman's noose.

Meanwhile, the CNB officers and police will also work to bring you to justice. They'll check your bank accounts, e-mail and phone records and those of your suspected accomplices, their intel sources and decide whether you deserve to die from the hangman's noose.

========

How do law enforcement officers suspect a person is bringing drugs into SG?

1. Intelligence. No doubt some of the CNB officers work undercover or have moles working for them in syndicates. Your name shouldn't even be on their radar if you haven't been trafficking drugs.

2. Random checks at border crossings. If you really are caught with drugs in your possession by some conspiracy not of your own doing, you must have had a huge dose of bad luck.

=============

Based on the evidence, the public prosecutors will deliberate over whether you deserve to hang in the first place. They can choose to charge you with the amount required for you to hang, or not. The judge isn't a rubber-stamp. He can choose to disagree with the prosecutors that you deserve hanging. Your counsel will do his best to clear your name in any case. 

But let's say ths prosecution decides to charge you with the death penalty, the judge will weigh both sides of the argument to determine your fate.

If you are sentenced to hang, then you would need to go to the Court of Appeal to argue your case. Round Two between your counsel and prosecution. Again, the judges will look at the evidence provided by both sides to decide your fate.

But lets say you've endured two huge miscarriages of justice, you can appeal to the President for clemency (a joke, I know, but still, it's there). 

After your clemency has been rejected, it isn't the end just yet. You'll be on death row for many, many years. During this period, your lawyer and loved ones still have time to find proof that you aren't involved in the drug trade until the day you take that walk to the gallows. Also, during this time, if new evidence emerges, then you can have the case re-opened, even though it's very difficult.

Until the day comes when Singapore has a corrupt judiciary (at this moment, it ranks as one of the least corrupted governments in the world), then an inmocent person should worry about getting caught. But until then, the average person entering Singapore's borders an rest relatively easily if some criminal concocts a conspiracy to have a crook plant a drug on him/her and then have another crook collect it after with him/her being none the wiser.",1,comment,Negative
