Yeah cause of factors like 1. They already have weed there so if you manage to smuggle it it wont really make an impact. sg doesnt have weed. 2. Our neighbouring countries are economically poorer (+ they have steady supply) than us so obviously more will try their luck if punishment is lax. If they even manage to make 1 delivery then its quite worth. If not? At max just get deported/jailed lorh. 3. Land size. Sg is a small country w/ limited land size. We wont have enough prisons if our too lax measures lead to more people trying to traffick and end up getting convicted in jail as a result.

Perhaps there can be a very conservative ceiling on the amount a person can consume or carry, and heavily-regulated supply chains and stores for buying and consumption. People who flout the law could be sentenced to jail / caning as per other serious offences. Furthermore, while some research note that some MJ users do go on to use harder drugs, most do not.

We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.
