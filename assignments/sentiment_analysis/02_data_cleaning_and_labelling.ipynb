Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture. TBH, I never really agreed with this argument because I think that the death penalty should perhaps only be used in the case of premeditated murder. A life for a life. Anything else is morally incoherent.\\n\\nThat said, if you want to make a strawman that makes other people sound hypocritical, that may not be the characterization your should be fighting for.\\n\\nIf you want to make accusations about hypocrisy, maybe look at the Sg government? We launder money from HNW government figures from narco states like North Korea and Myanmar. We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.\\n\\nI think the party whose stance on drugs is ' we are going to kill you for smuggling drugs until you start making above a certain amount of money then we are going to become accomplices and help you launder it and turn a blind eye when you recruit our residents' is the one that is hypocritical.\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North\\_Korea%E2%80%93Singapore\\_relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93Singapore_relations)\\n\\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN138922](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN138922)\\n\\n[https://www.voanews.com/a/un-myanmar-drug-dealing-militias-rebel-armies-ramping-up/6471711.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/un-myanmar-drug-dealing-militias-rebel-armies-ramping-up/6471711.html)\\n\\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/)\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong\\_Su\\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong_Su_incident)\\n\\n[https://scandasia.com/2376-singaporean-heroin-smuggler-gets-24-years-for-drug-run/](https://scandasia.com/2376-singaporean-heroin-smuggler-gets-24-years-for-drug-run/)</td>\n",

       "10   The argument is that the mandatory death penalty is ineffectual because you tend to wind up executing large numbers of mules who basically don't impact the drug trade. Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture. TBH, I never really agreed with this argument because I think that the death penalty should perhaps only be used in the case of premeditated murder. A life for a life. Anything else is morally incoherent.\\n\\nThat said, if you want to make a strawman that makes other people sound hypocritical, that may not be the characterization your should be fighting for.\\n\\nIf you want to make accusations about hypocrisy, maybe look at the Sg government? We launder money from HNW government figures from narco states like North Korea and Myanmar. We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.\\n\\nI think the party whose stance on drugs is ' we are going to kill you for smuggling drugs until you start making above a certain amount of money then we are going to become accomplices and help you launder it and turn a blind eye when you recruit our residents' is the one that is hypocritical.\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North\\_Korea%E2%80%93Singapore\\_relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93Singapore_relations)\\n\\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN138922](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN138922)\\n\\n[https://www.voanews.com/a/un-myanmar-drug-dealing-militias-rebel-armies-ramping-up/6471711.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/un-myanmar-drug-dealing-militias-rebel-armies-ramping-up/6471711.html)\\n\\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/)\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong\\_Su\\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong_Su_incident)\\n\\n[https://scandasia.com/2376-singaporean-heroin-smuggler-gets-24-years-for-drug-run/](https://scandasia.com/2376-singaporean-heroin-smuggler-gets-24-years-for-drug-run/)  \\\n",

      "The argument is that the mandatory death penalty is ineffectual because you tend to wind up executing large numbers of mules who basically don't impact the drug trade. Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture.

Anything else is morally incoherent.\n",

We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.\n",

      "Singapore's main stance is derived from viewing MJ as a gateway drug to other more harmful drugs like cocaine or heroin. The fear is that if MJ is legal, rampant use could lead to people getting into harder drugs to the detriment of society. However, I argue that this point can be sustained without sentencing MJ traffickers and users to death. Perhaps there can be a very conservative ceiling on the amount a person can consume or carry, and heavily-regulated supply chains and stores for buying and consumption. People who flout the law could be sentenced to jail / caning as per other serious offences. Furthermore, while some research note that some MJ users do go on to use harder drugs, most do not. Heightened response to other drugs is also not unique to MJ - alcohol causes such a response too.\n",

       "      <td>The argument is that the mandatory death penalty is ineffectual because you tend to wind up executing large numbers of mules who basically don't impact the drug trade. Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture. TBH, I never really agreed with this argument because I think that the death penalty should perhaps only be used in the case of premeditated murder. A life for a life. Anything else is morally incoherent.\\n\\nThat said, if you want to make a strawman that makes other people sound hypocritical, that may not be the characterization your should be fighting for.\\n\\nIf you want to make accusations about hypocrisy, maybe look at the Sg government? We launder money from HNW government figures from narco states like North Korea and Myanmar. We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.\\n\\nI think the party whose stance on drugs is ' we are going to kill you for smuggling drugs until you start making above a certain amount of money then we are going to become accomplices and help you launder it and turn a blind eye when you recruit our residents' is the one that is hypocritical.\\n\\n[[[[[[</td>\n",

This was largely a circumstantial case that relied on inferences. Investigators and prosecutors acted on the fact that his mobile numbers were stored on the actual drug traffickers’ phone, interpreting phone records and text messages as “proof” of his involvement. Tangaraju’s alleged co-conspirator – who was actually caught in possession of the drugs – pleaded guilty to a non-capital offence. The other three people connected to the case were “discharged not amounting to an acquittal” by the prosecution.

Both mules were arrested by CNB and he kept communicating with them without realising they were arrested. CNB also listened in to the call and guided the  conversation of the Malaysian mule. \\n\\nHe was convicted on the strength of what Justice Hoo called “objective evidence” - the numerous logged calls he made the day before and that day from his 2 mobiles to the mules even after the arrest. This is over and above the 2 mules implicating him. \\n\\nHe did not disclose his upstream and downstream suppliers and dealers and repeatedly denied even making the calls.

       "10  The argument is that the mandatory death penalty is ineffectual because you tend to wind up executing large numbers of mules who basically don't impact the drug trade. Occasionally getting some mid level facilitator like this guy does not change the overall picture. TBH, I never really agreed with this argument because I think that the death penalty should perhaps only be used in the case of premeditated murder. A life for a life. Anything else is morally incoherent.\\n\\nThat said, if you want to make a strawman that makes other people sound hypocritical, that may not be the characterization your should be fighting for.\\n\\nIf you want to make accusations about hypocrisy, maybe look at the Sg government? We launder money from HNW government figures from narco states like North Korea and Myanmar. We we allow their leaders who are widely known to be facilitators in the drug trade to come here for treatment and luxury shopping that they are unable get in homes countries because they have destroyed them. North Korea in particular is long known for using its embassies to smuggle drugs. We are one of the few countries to host a North Korean Embassy.  The embassy here in particular is well known for being used for sanctions busting and other illicit activity. North Korea has in the past recruited Singaporean nationals to conduct heroin smuggling in other people's countries. I can find no evidence that CNB so much as investigated them.\\n\\nI think the party whose stance on drugs is ' we are going to kill you for smuggling drugs until you start making above a certain amount of money then we are going to become accomplices and help you launder it and turn a blind eye when you recruit our residents' is the one that is hypocritical.\\n\\n[[[[[[   \n",

This was largely a circumstantial case that relied on inferences. Investigators and prosecutors acted on the fact that his mobile numbers were stored on the actual drug traffickers’ phone, interpreting phone records and text messages as “proof” of his involvement. Tangaraju’s alleged co-conspirator – who was actually caught in possession of the drugs – pleaded guilty to a non-capital offence. The other three people connected to the case were “discharged not amounting to an acquittal” by the prosecution. Tangaraju himself has maintained his innocence from the very beginning of his ordeal.*\\n\\nFlimsy argument leh. He just want to kpkb, then chose this case to brigade sibo.   \n",
